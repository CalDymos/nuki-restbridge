## 📌 Overview

**Nuki REST Bridge** allows full local integration of Nuki Smart Locks via REST – no cloud, no MQTT broker required. It runs on an ESP32 and connects to Nuki devices over BLE while exposing a simple REST API.

> 🔗 **Fork Notice**: This project is a **disconnected fork** of [Nuki Hub](https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub). It's not actively synchronized with upstream and has diverged significantly.

- Offers direct REST access for smart home platforms (e.g., Loxone Miniserver).
- Ideal for standalone environments without MQTT or external bridges.

> 💡 If using PoE: A [PoE to USB/Ethernet splitter](https://www.berrybase.de/poe-splitter-rj45-48v-usb-type-c-stecker-5v-2-5a) can also be used.

---

## ✅ Recommended ESP32 Boards

We recommend using dual-core ESP32 boards with stable BLE + Wi-Fi support and sufficient RAM:

- ESP32-WROOM-32 (standard dual-core ESP32)
- ESP32-WROVER (more RAM, ideal for PSRAM and SSL)
- ESP32-DevKitC

Avoid low-RAM models if using HAR or logging features extensively.

## 🚫 Not Recommended

Avoid single-core ESP32 variants such as:

- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-C6
- ESP32-H2
- ESP32-Solo1

The bridge uses both CPU cores to handle BLE scanning, client connections, and webserver tasks. Single-core models may experience performance issues or instability.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

Flash the firmware to your ESP32 board using the provided binaries or by compiling via PlatformIO.

---

### Initial Network Setup

1. Power on the ESP32.
2. Connect to the new Wi-Fi AP: `NukiRestBridge`
   - Password: `NukiBridgeESP32`
3. Open browser: [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1)
4. Select and connect to your home Wi-Fi.

ESP32 will then connect to the selected network.

---

### Pairing with a Nuki Lock (1.0 to 4.0)

1. Enable *Bluetooth pairing* in the Nuki app:
   - Settings → Features & Configuration → Button and LED
2. Hold button on Nuki device for a few seconds.
3. ESP32 will auto-pair whenever it is powered and if no lock is currently paired.
4. Web UI will confirm with: `Paired: Yes`, if successful.

---

## 🛠️ Configuration

In your browser, open the IP address of the ESP32 to access the Web Config interface.

You can configure:

---

### Network Configuration

#### General Settings

- **Host name**: Set the hostname for the Nuki Rest Bridge ESP
- **Network hardware**: "Wi-Fi only" by default, set to ethernet if available
- **RSSI send interval**: Set to a positive integer to specify the number of seconds between sending the current Wi-Fi RSSI; set to -1 to disable, default value 60
  > 📘 **Note:** Requires Home Automation Reporting to be enabled
- **Restart on disconnect**: Enable to restart the Nuki Rest Bridge when disconnected from the network.
- **Find Wi-Fi AP with strongest signal**: Uses the AP with the strongest signal for the connection via Wi-Fi

---

#### IP Address Assignment

- **Enable DHCP**: Enable to use DHCP for obtaining an IP address, disable to use the static IP settings below
- **Static IP address**: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred static IP address for the Nuki Bridge to use
- **Subnet**: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred subnet for the Nuki Bridge to use
- **Default gateway**: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred gateway IP address for the Nuki Bridge to use
- **DNS Server**: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred DNS server IP address for the Nuki Bridge to use

---

### REST API Configuration

- **Enable REST API**: Activate the Rest Web Server to receive requests
- **API Port**: Set the port number for the REST API (default: 80)
- **Access Token**: Set an access token to secure the REST API.

---

### HAR Configuration

#### Connection Settings

- **Enable Home Automation Report**: Enable to periodically send status updates (e.g. RSSI, lock state, battery) to a Home Automation system.
- **Address**: Set to the IP address of Home Automation
- **Port**: Set to the Port of Home Automation
- **Mode**: Select either UDP or REST.
  >📘 **Note:** In UDP mode, the fields marked as Path are ignored. Only the Param values are used. In REST mode, both Path and Query fields are required.
- **REST Request Method**: Select Methode for Rest Request GET/POST.
  >📘 **Note:** only available if REST Mode is selected
- **User**: Optional username for authenticating with the Home Automation system. Use `#` to disable authentication.
  >📘 **Note:** only available if REST Mode is selected
- **Password**: Password corresponding to the username. Use `#` to disable authentication.
  >📘 **Note:** only available if REST Mode is selected

---

#### Report Settings

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> In **REST mode**, the **Query** field may optionally include a full query string, such as `?action=set&ext=Extension1&io=Q1&value=`.  
> The actual value will be appended automatically during transmission. This allows compatibility with systems like **Loxone** and **Comexio** without special handling.  
>
> In **UDP mode**, the **Path** field is not available — instead, the **Param** field is **required**.  
>
> In **REST mode**, leaving the **Key** field empty disables sending the corresponding report.  
> In **UDP mode**, leaving the **Param** field empty does the same.

  > 🚨 **Important:** For security reasons, not all configurations can be changed via the REST API.

---

#### Nuki Lock Access Control

### Credentials

#### Web Configurator Credentials

- **User**: Pick a username to enable HTTP authentication for the Web Configuration, Set to "#" to disable authentication.
- **Password/Retype password**: Pick a password to enable HTTP authentication for the Web Configuration.

Digest authentication is more secure than Basic or Form based authentication, especially over unencrypted (HTTP) connections. Form based authentication works best with password managers. Note: Firefox seems to have issues with basic authentication.
- **Bypass authentication for reverse proxy with IP**: IP for which authentication is bypassed. Use in conjunction with a reverse proxy server with separate authentication.

#### Nuki Lock PIN

- **PIN Code**: Fill with the Nuki Security Code of the Nuki Lock. Required for functions that require the security code to be sent to the lock such as setting lock permissions/adding keypad codes, viewing the activity log or changing the Nuki device configuration. Set to "#" to remove the security code from the Nuki Bridge configuration.

---

#### Unpair Nuki Lock

- **Type [4 DIGIT CODE] to confirm unpair**: Set to the shown randomly generated code to unpair the Nuki Lock from the Nuki Bridge.

---

#### Factory reset Nuki Bridge

- **Type [4 DIGIT CODE] to confirm factory reset**: Set to the shown randomly generated code to reset all Nuki Hub settings to default and unpair Nuki Lock and/or Opener. Optionally also reset Wi-Fi settings to default (and reopen the Wi-Fi configurator) by enabling the checkbox.

---

## 🌐 REST API Endpoints

All REST API endpoints are accessible via the configured port (default: `8080`).  
🔐 **All endpoints require a valid Access Token** in the HTTP header or query string — **except** for `/shutdown`.

> 🧩 Format:  
> `http://<bridge-ip>:<port>/<endpoint>?token=<your-token>`

### 🔑 Authentication

Every request must include the access token as:
- HTTP query parameter: `?token=yourtoken`
- or HTTP header: `Authorization: Bearer yourtoken`

> ⚠️ The only exception is the `/shutdown` endpoint, which does **not** require a token.

## Recommended LAN Setup

> 🔐 **Note:** The Nuki REST Bridge uses HTTP for communication, which means that data is transmitted in plain text within the local network — unlike HTTPS.  
> While this poses only a minimal risk in secured home environments, proper precautions should still be taken.  
> The following steps help minimize that risk when HTTP is the only available method. They do not replace encryption but reduce exposure within a trusted LAN.
