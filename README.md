## üìå Overview

**Nuki REST Bridge** allows full local integration of Nuki Smart Locks via REST ‚Äì no cloud, no MQTT broker required. It runs on an ESP32 and connects to Nuki devices over BLE while exposing a simple REST API.

> üîó **Fork Notice**: This project is a **disconnected fork** of [Nuki Hub](https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub). It's not actively synchronized with upstream and has diverged significantly.

- Offers direct REST access for smart home platforms (e.g., Loxone Miniserver).
- Ideal for standalone environments without MQTT or external bridges.

## ‚úÖ Supported Devices

### ESP32 Boards (Wi-Fi + BLE)

| ‚úÖ Supported | ‚ùå Not Supported |
|-------------|------------------|
| All dual-core ESP32 boards with Wi-Fi + BLE supported by ESP-IDF 5.3.2 / Arduino Core 3.1.3 | ESP32-S2 (no BLE) |

### Nuki Devices

- Nuki Smart Lock 1.0 ‚Üí 4.0

### Ethernet Support

The following boards with **built-in Ethernet** are supported:

- [Olimex ESP32-POE / POE-ISO](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/)
- [WT32-ETH01](http://en.wireless-tag.com/product-item-2.html)
- [LilyGO T-ETH / T-ETH-POE](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-ETH-Series)
- [Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH / POE](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-eth.htm)
- [ESP32-poe-dev board](https://github.com/jorticus/esp32-poe-dev)
- [wESP32](https://wesp32.com/)

> üí° If using PoE: A [PoE to USB/Ethernet splitter](https://www.berrybase.de/poe-splitter-rj45-48v-usb-type-c-stecker-5v-2-5a) can be used.

## üö´ Not Recommended

Avoid single-core ESP32 variants (e.g., ESP32-C3, C6, H2, Solo1). The bridge benefits from dual-core execution to handle BLE + REST effectively.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

Flash the firmware to your ESP32 board using the provided binaries or by compiling via PlatformIO.

### Initial Network Setup

1. Power on the ESP32.
2. Connect to the new Wi-Fi AP: `NukiRestBridge`
   - Password: `NukiBridgeESP32`
3. Open browser: [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1)
4. Select and connect to your home Wi-Fi.

ESP32 will then connect to the selected network.

### Pairing with a Nuki Lock (1.0‚Äì4.0)

1. Enable *Bluetooth pairing* in the Nuki app:
   - Settings ‚Üí Features & Configuration ‚Üí Button and LED
2. Hold button on Nuki device for a few seconds.
3. ESP32 will auto-pair whenever it is powered and if no lock is currently paired.
4. Web UI will confirm with: `Paired: Yes`, if successful.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

In your browser, open the IP address of the ESP32 to access the Web Config interface.

You can configure:

### Network Configuration

#### General Settings

- Host name: Set the hostname for the Nuki Rest Bridge ESP
- Network hardware: "Wi-Fi only" by default, set to ethernet if available
- RSSI send interval: Set to a positive integer to specify the number of seconds between sending the current Wi-Fi RSSI; set to -1 to disable, default value 60
*(Requires Home Automation Reporting to be enabled)*
- Restart on disconnect: Enable to restart the Nuki Rest Bridge when disconnected from the network.
- Find WiFi AP with strongest signal: Uses the AP with the strongest signal for the connection via Wifi

#### IP Address assignment

- Enable DHCP: Enable to use DHCP for obtaining an IP address, disable to use the static IP settings below
- Static IP address: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred static IP address for the Nuki Bridge to use
- Subnet: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred subnet for the Nuki Hub to use
- Default gateway: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred gateway IP address for the Nuki Bridge to use
- DNS Server: When DHCP is disabled set to the preferred DNS server IP address for the Nuki Bridge to use

---

### REST API Configuration

- Enable REST API: Activate the Rest Web Server to receive requests
- API Port: Set the port number for the REST API (default: 80)
- Access Token: Set an access token to secure the REST API.
